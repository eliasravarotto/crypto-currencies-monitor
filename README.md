## First steps

#### Installing node

Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Nvm approach is preferred.

#### Getting dependencies

Run `npm install` or `yarn` from rootpath of the project.


#### Starting your app

Now, we have two ways to start an app. To start your app in production mode run `npm start` in the root path of your project. To start your app in development mode (nodemon) run `npm run start-dev`. Then access your app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you ran the start script.

## Development

#### Environments

By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **NODE_ENV** environmental variable.

#### Environment variables

`Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They are stored in the `/.env` file. Take into account that the variables defined in the `bashrc` are not overrided.

The environment variables should be added to the `.env` file in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, as the following example:

```
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASS=superpass
DB_PASSWORD=superpass
PORT=8081
CLIENTS_API=http://api.clients.example.org/
```

**Remember not to push nor commit the `.env` file.**

#### Logging

To log useful information of your program to the console you just need to import the logger located at `app/logger`. There are two possible types of logging: `info` and `error`. You should use them depending on the type of message you want to show.

Here is an example snippet:

```
const logger = require('/app/logger');
...
if (error) {
    logger.error('There is an error);
} else {
    logger.info('There is no error);
}
```

## Deploy

#### Heroku

Pushing the desired branch to heroku should be enough.

### Model Relationships examples
`
// articles.js
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Article = sequelize.define(..., ... ,...);
    Article.associate = models => {
    Article.belongsTo(models.User, { foreignKey: 'userId' });
    Article.hasMany(models.Tagging, { foreignKey: 'taggableId' });
  };

  return Article;
};
`
// tagging.js
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Tagging = sequelize.define(..., ... ,...);
  
  Tagging.associate = models => {
    Tagging.belongsTo(models.Tag, { foreignKey: 'tagId' });
    Tagging.belongsTo(models.Article, { foreignKey: 'taggableId' });
  };
    return Tagging;
};

// Tag.js
module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  const Tag = sequelize.define(..., ... ,...);
  
  Tag.associate = models => Tag.hasMany(models.Tagging, { foreignKey: 'tagId' });
  
  return Tag;
};
